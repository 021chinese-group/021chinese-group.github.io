            ProTalk is a seminar hosted by 021 club where U of T students from different faculties share and discuss
            their ideas and opinions on different topics. Discussions are based on topics from relevant materials
            prepared before the ProTalk, as well as hands-on experience in real-life situations. Participants will
            discuss all the problems involved in the topic, present potential ideas and solutions and describe their                thought process. All the topics are derived from the real problems that were encountered in the development
            of projects or professional topics from their respective industry. Discussions are designed to help you
            solve or find solutions to problems and improve your thought process and critical thinking skills. Each
            session of ProTalk will have no more than 10 participants to give everyone the opportunity to share their
            ideas and opinions.
